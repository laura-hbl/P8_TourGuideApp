## Metrics
Through the class called TestPerformance, we are able to effectively monitor gpsUtil and rewardsCentral metrics over time, in minutes. these tests allow you to track all user location and calculate the rewards for each user. The number of users generated for testing can be easily adjusted via test.user.numbers in the application-test.properties file.
